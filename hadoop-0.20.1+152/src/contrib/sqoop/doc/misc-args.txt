Miscellaneous Additional Arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to generate the Java classes to represent tables without
actually performing an import, supply a connect string and
(optionally) credentials as above, as well as +--all-tables+ or
+--table+, but also use the +--generate-only+ argument. This will
generate the classes and cease further operation.

You can override the +$HADOOP_HOME+ environment variable within Sqoop
with the +--hadoop-home+ argument. You can override the +$HIVE_HOME+
environment variable with +--hive-home+.

Data emitted to HDFS is by default uncompressed. You can instruct
Sqoop to use gzip to compress your data by providing either the
+--compress+ or +-z+ argument (both are equivalent).
