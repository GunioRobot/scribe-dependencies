Supported Databases
-------------------

Sqoop uses JDBC to connect to databases. JDBC is a compatibility layer
that allows a program to access many different databases through a common
API. Slight differences in the SQL language spoken by each database, however,
may mean that Sqoop can't use every database out of the box, or that some
databases may be used in an inefficient manner.

When you provide a connect string to Sqoop, it inspects the protocol scheme to
determine appropriate vendor-specific logic to use. If Sqoop knows about
a given database, it will work automatically. If not, you may need to
specify the driver class to load via +--driver+. This will use a generic
code path which will use standard SQL to access the database. Sqoop provides
some databases with faster, non-JDBC-based access mechanisms. These can be
enabled by specfying the +--direct+ parameter.

Sqoop includes vendor-specific code paths for the following databases:

[grid="all"]
`-----------`--------`--------------------`---------------------
Database    version  +--direct+ support?  connect string matches
----------------------------------------------------------------
HSQLDB      1.8.0+   No                   +jdbc:hsqldb:*//+
MySQL       5.0+     Yes                  +jdbc:mysql://+
Oracle      10.2.0+  No                   +jdbc:oracle:*//+
PostgreSQL  8.3+     Yes                  +jdbc:postgresql://+
----------------------------------------------------------------

Sqoop may work with older versions of the databases listed, but we have
only tested it with the versions specified above.

Even if Sqoop supports a database internally, you may still need to
install the database vendor's JDBC driver in your +$HADOOP_HOME/lib+
path.
