Listing Available Databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once connected to a database server, you can list the available
databases with the +--list-databases+ parameter. This currently is supported
only by HSQLDB and MySQL. Note that in this case, the connect string does
not include a database name, just a server address.

----
$ sqoop --connect jdbc:mysql://database.example.com/ --list-databases
information_schema
employees
----
_This only works with HSQLDB and MySQL. A vendor-agnostic implementation of
this function has not yet been implemented._
