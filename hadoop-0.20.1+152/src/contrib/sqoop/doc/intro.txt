Introduction
------------

Sqoop is a tool designed to help users of large data import
existing relational databases into their Hadoop clusters. Sqoop uses
JDBC to connect to a database, examine each table's schema, and
auto-generate the necessary classes to import data into HDFS. It
then instantiates a MapReduce job to read tables from the database
via the DBInputFormat (JDBC-based InputFormat). Tables are read
into a set of files loaded into HDFS. Both SequenceFile and
text-based targets are supported. Sqoop also supports high-performance
imports from select databases including MySQL.

This document describes how to get started using Sqoop to import
your data into Hadoop.
